# NN_Greek_Alphabet_Classifier

### Project developed for 'Knowledge and Reasoning', a second year subject @ISEC

Made in collaboration with another student

#### Guide:

This project consists of implementing and testing different feedforward neural network (NN) architectures to correctly classify Greek characters.
It is divided in several stages because it was required for the subject, but the main is ```GUI.mlapp``` where you can load, save, test, train, compare and draw a greek letter.
